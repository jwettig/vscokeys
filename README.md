# VSCO Keys Layout
My own layout for vsco-keys 

## What it is
[VSCO Keys](https://github.com/vsco/keys) ist now open source and you have to create your own shortcuts via a configfile. This repository just contains my very own config file. It's quite simple and inspired by the simple layout from VSCO. But of course I wanted my own small changes so I had to create this.

## How do I read the lines
For this you should look at the Keys documentation but I just want to explain what my layout does (I hope I recall it correctly):
* Keys 1 to 0 apply the VSCO Keys Presets 01 to 10
* Ctrl and up/down changes the exposure
* Strl and left/right changes contrast
* N/M changes highlights
* Ctrl and N/M changes whites
* V/B changes shadows
* Ctrl and V/B changes blacks
* Alt and left/right changes temperature
* Alt and up/down changes tint
* Shift and left/right changes vibrance
* Shift and up/down changes saturation
* K/L changes luminance noise reduction
* ,/. changes Vignette
* Ctrl and ,/. changes the clarity

## How to use it
Make a backup of the file and double click it while Lightroom / VSCO Keys is running. That's it.
